# Ultrasonic-Distance-Measurement-Using-PIC-16F877A-and-HC-SR04-Sensor
The aim of this project is to design and implement an inexpensive and effective device which can measure distance using ultrasonic sound. The systemâ€™s cost is reduced with the use of the PIC16F877A micro-controller, and it is made non-contact through the use of the HC-SR04 ultrasonic transducer module.
